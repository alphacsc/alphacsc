    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like 1d
        voltage time series
    L : float
        window length (seconds)

        Pre-set locations of initial windows (instead of evenly spaced by 2G)
    random_state : int
        The random state

    Returns
    -------
    avg_window : ndarray (1d)
        The average waveform in x.

        Indices at which each window begins for the final set of windows
    J : np.ndarray (1d)
        Cost function value at each iteration
