def split_signal(X, n_splits=1, apply_window=True):
    """Split the signal in ``n_splits`` chunks for faster training.

    This function can be used to accelerate the dictionary learning algorithm
    by creating independent chunks that can be processed in parallel. This can
    bias the estimation and can create border artifacts so the number of chunks
    should be kept as small as possible (`e.g.` equal to ``n_jobs``).

    Also, it is advised to not use the result of this function to
    call the ``DictionaryLearning.transform`` method, as it would return an
    approximate reduction of the original signal in the sparse basis.

    Note that this is a lossy operation, as all chunks will have length
    ``n_times // n_splits`` and the last ``n_times % n_splits`` samples are
    discarded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray, shape (n_channels, n_times) or (1, n_channels, n_times)
        Signal to be split. It should be a single signal.
    n_splits : int (default: 1)
        Number of splits to create from the original signal. Default is 1.
    apply_window : bool (default: True)
        If set to True (default), a tukey window is applied to each split to
        reduce the border artifacts by reducing the weights of the chunk
        borders.

    Returns
    -------
    X_split: ndarray, shape (n_splits, n_channels, n_times // n_splits)
        The signal splitted in ``n_splits``.
